We see that this is an intercross with `r nind(sug)` individuals.
There are `r nphe(sug)` phenotypes, and genotype data at
`r totmar(sug)` markers across the `r nchr(sug)` autosomes.  The genotype
data is quite complete.

Use `plot()` to get a summary plot of the data.

```{r summary_plot, fig.height=8}
plot(sug)
```
