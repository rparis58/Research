Ok. Looks like using Ulysses as the Markdown editor is a really great way to go.
can do this in a cool editor with the files being saved in the same directory as used by Studio.  both can render the markdown.

**i think the way to do this is to use Ulysses to keep track of the outline of whats happening and then have separate code segments that can then be added into thisÂ **
