Hadley takes the approach that the best way to start Data Science is analysis of “small data” as the techniques carry over to “big data”. I agree.

# Approach
start with class(mpg)  to find out that its a data.frame
dim(mpg) to find the dimensions (row,col)
str(mpg)
summary(mpg)
if not a factor consider unique()  e.g. unique(mpg$drv)    “f” 4” “r”
